# advent-of-code-2025

I'm using advent of code 2025 to learn go.

## For each day

1. Create a new `day*` directory for the corresponding day
2. Create a new `input.txt` file in the `day*` directory containing the puzzle input
3. Add `main.go` and `main_test.go` files
4. Run `go test` to validate against the example input
5. Run `go run main.go` (the `-part n` flag can be used to determine which part of the puzzle to run)
